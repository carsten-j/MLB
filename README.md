# Machine Learning B at DIKU, KU - spring 2025

This is a **Machine Learning B** course project from DIKU (Department of Computer Science), University of Copenhagen, Spring 2025.

The project contains 7 homework assignments covering core ML topics:

- **HA1**: Concentration inequalities, bounds theory, Occam's razor
- **HA2**: Convex optimization fundamentals (cones, epigraphs)  
- **HA3**: SVMs and logistic regression with MNIST dataset
- **HA4**: Overbooking optimization problem
- **HA5**: Statistical learning theory and confidence intervals
- **HA6**: Ensemble methods (AdaBoost) with landcover classification
- **HA7**: Gradient boosting (XGBoost) with quasars dataset

Additional theory exploration includes conjugate functions, duality theory, and quasi-convexity visualization tools. Each assignment has LaTeX reports, Python implementations, and generated figures.
