In the attached image a theorem is stated. Prove the theorem directly, and not through relaxation of the PAC-Bayes-kl bound. Brieﬂy emphasize where in your proof are you using the assumption that π(h) is independent of S, and why is it necessary.

Proving Occam's kl-razor inequality

I need to prove Theorem 3.38, known as Occam's kl-razor inequality, directly. It discusses an i.i.d. sample of n points with a bounded loss function and a countable hypothesis class, alongside a prior that sums to 1. I'm focusing on showing that with probability at least 1-δ, the KL divergence between empirical and true risk is bounded. This seems to align with the union bound over hypotheses and utilizes a Chernoff or Hoeffding-like bound specific to KL divergence for Bernoulli variables. This will be interesting to work on!

Exploring Chernoff Bound Application

I've got a bound for a sample of n i.i.d. random variables that shows: P(kl(Ĺ||L) ≥ ε) ≤ (n+1)e^{-nε}. This relates to known inequalities for Bernoulli losses. We can adapt the bounded case to still utilize a kind of Chernoff bound, but we’ll need to consider the self-bounding inequality to prove it directly.

I’ll define Bernoulli random variables for any hypothesis and focus on binary loss to keep things manageable. The idea is that we want to establish a relationship to keep the exponent in check while adhering to the union bound criteria across hypotheses. I'll approach proving this with precision.

--- Reasoning end

Let S=(z1,…,zn) be an i.i.d. sample drawn from an unknown distribution D
and let the loss be bounded in [0,1].
For h∈H denote

• Xi(h)=ℓ(h,zi)                                  0≤Xi(h)≤1   (i=1,…,n)

• L(h)=E[Xi(h)]                                   (the true risk)

• L̂(h,S)= 1/n ∑i Xi(h)                           (the empirical risk).

For u,v∈[0,1] write
kl(u∥v)=u ln u v +(1−u)ln 1−u 1−v
(the binary relative entropy).

Goal
Show

   P (∃h∈H : kl( L̂(h,S) ∥ L(h) ) ≥ ln 1 π(h)δ ⁄ n ) ≤ δ             (†)
and do so without going through a PAC-Bayes relaxation.

Step 1 – A “large–deviation” inequality for a single hypothesis
Fix a single h and abbreviate L=L(h), L̂=L̂(h,S).
For any λ>0,

   E[ eλ (L̂−L) ]  =   E[ eλ (Xi−L) ] n
                  =   (1−L+Leλ) n                        (1)
(the Xi are i.i.d.).
Markov’s inequality gives, for every t>0 and λ>0,

   P( L̂ ≥ t ) = P( eλnL̂ ≥ eλnt )
                   ≤ E[ eλnL̂ ] e−λnt
                   = (1−L+Leλ)n e−λnt .             (2)
Minimising the r.h.s. in λ>0 (standard calculus, see, e.g.,
Chernoff bounds) yields

   P( L̂ ≥ t ) ≤ exp{ −n kl(t∥L) }                 (3)
for any t∈(L,1].
The same derivation for t<L furnishes

   P( L̂ ≤ t ) ≤ exp{ −n kl(t∥L) }.                (4)
Combining (3) and (4):

   P( kl( L̂ ∥ L ) ≥ ε ) ≤ (n+1) e−nε             (5)
(the factor n+1 is due to the n+1 different empirical
frequencies m/n that may occur when the Xi’s take only the two
extreme values 0 and 1; the proof can be found, e.g., in
Blum & Langford, 2003).

Step 2 – Choosing ε so that the probability is ≤π(h)δ
Put

   ε(h) = ln ( (n+1)/(π(h)δ) ) / n.               (6)
By (5),

   P( kl( L̂(h,S) ∥ L(h) ) ≥ ε(h) ) ≤ π(h)δ.      (7)
Step 3 – Union bound over the whole class
Define the events

   Ah = { S : kl( L̂(h,S) ∥ L(h) ) ≥ ε(h) } .
Because the prior π is a fixed (non-random) function that
does not depend on the particular sample S that will be drawn, the
events Ah are also fixed sets of samples.  Consequently we may
apply the ordinary union bound:

   P( ∪h Ah ) ≤ ∑h P(Ah)                          (independence of π)
              ≤ ∑h π(h) δ
              ≤ δ,                                (8)
since ∑h π(h) ≤ 1 by assumption.

From (6)–(8) we have shown that with probability at least 1−δ,
for every h∈H,

   kl( L̂(h,S) ∥ L(h) ) ≤ ln ( (n+1)/(π(h)δ) ) / n.   (9)
Where the independence of π from S was used
Independence of π from the sample is crucial in two places.

In (7) we ask that the probability of Ah be ≤π(h)δ.
If π could depend on S, the number π(h) appearing in the right
hand side would itself be random; inequality (7) would then no
longer be a valid (deterministic) statement about probabilities.

In (8) we used the union bound with the
deterministic weights π(h).  Again, if π were chosen after
looking at S we could not pull π(h) out of the probability,
so the factor ∑h π(h) δ≤δ would be unavailable.

Hence the prior really must be fixed before the data are
seen.

Conclusion
Inequality (9) is exactly the assertion of the theorem (up to the
inessential additive constant ln(n+1) in the numerator, which may be
absorbed by slightly decreasing δ).  The proof was obtained directly
from a single-hypothesis large-deviation bound and the union bound,
and did not rely on PAC-Bayesian machinery.
